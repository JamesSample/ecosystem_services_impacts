# Estimating the impacts of land use and climate change on Scotland's water-related ecosystem services

This repo contains Python code for estimating the potential impacts of climate and land use change on a range of water-related ecosystem services. The approach has been used to support Scotland's [second cycle of River Basin Management Planning](http://www.sepa.org.uk/environment/water/river-basin-management-planning/) and combines spatially distributed simulations of land use and climate with a qualitative risk assessment framework based on expert elicitation. Further details of the code are provided [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JamesSample/ecosystem_services_impacts/blob/master/ecosystem_services_notes.ipynb).
